            As part of the coursework for the Integrated Electrical Project (IEP), the features of a low-pass $RC$ filter were dimensioned with an oscilloscope. The aims were to compare the measured characteristic time $\tau$ and attenuation curve to the taught theoretical model, taking into account the tolerances of the physical components. It was found that the theoretical model disagreed significantly with respect to $\tau$, although a refinement of it is presented which greatly enhances its descriptive power. The attenuation data matched the theoretical estimate closely but for a couple of important outliers.
